<p class="my-10">Hello, in this post I will tell you about how I made my website and this blog page. I will go over
   all the
   technologies I used and the reasoning behind them. Let's go!
</p>
<img src="/images/how-i-made-my-website.png" alt="Blog banner code image." class="w-full h-auto" />
<h3 class="text-3xl mt-10">1. Why</h3>
<p class="my-10">
   My website went through a number of iterations over the years. Some of them I'm more proud of than
   others.üòÅ But one thing was common for all of them - they were never finished! And when someone asked me for a
   contact or wanted to see my work I didn't really have a place to direct them to. So with my increasing knowledge
   of web development I decided it was time to change this and this website was created. I then also created this
   blog page to share my coding adventures.
</p>

<h3 class="text-3xl mt-10">2. The stack</h3>
<p class="mt-10">
   I knew I wanted a <a href="https://reactjs.org/" target="_blank">React</a> framework of some sort
   capable of SSG(static site generation). Initially, I wanted to try out <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/"
      target="_blank">Gatsby.js</a>, since it was new to me. But I wasn't really keen on the environment and the
   disability to use SSR(server side rendering). So I went with <a href="https://nextjs.org/"
      target="_blank">Next.js</a> in which I had some experience, which turned out to be a great choice.
</p>
<p class="mt-2">
   I love utility first CSS libraries, they save time and make your styles cleaner. My personal
   favourite is <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/" target="_blank">Tailwindcss</a>, which is what I used here.
</p>
<p class="mt-2">
   A big decision was to not use a database for storing blog posts. I figured that since the entire website is
   generated at build time storing metadata at the beginning of each post will work, more on this later. So far, this
   has been working perfectly fine.
</p>

<h3 class="text-3xl mt-10">3. How does the blog work</h3>
<p class="my-10">
   As I already mentioned I didn't use a database to store the individual blog posts, instead each post
   has its own html file containing all the necessary metadata in a kind of header as well as the content itself.
   Let's take a look at an example post created this way.
</p>

<h4 class="text-xl">Example blog post:</h4>
<pre>
   <code class="language-html">

   id: 1
   title: 'Awesome post'
   description: 'this is a great description'
   date: Wed Oct 06 2021

   &lt;h2&gt;Awesome post&lt;/h2&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Eu cillum aliquip deserunt ipsum sunt ut fugiat 
   minim in laboris commodo Lorem non.&lt;/p&gt;
   </code>
</pre>

<p>It's simple, the part beginning and ending with --- is the header and the rest is the content of the post.</p>

<p class="my-5">During build time, Next.js then goes through all the blog files and gets the header information and
   content, which is then injected into a blog template and rendered. To get the metadata I used a JS library called
   <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/front-matter" target="_blank">front-matter</a>.
</p>
<h4 class="text-xl">This is roughly how that works:</h4>
<pre>
   <code class="language-javascript">
   import * as fm from 'front-matter';
   // Next.js GetStaticProps function
   const getStaticProps = async ({ params }) => {
      // get post id from url
      const postName = params.id;
      // find the html file containing the blog by id
      // then use fs to read the content of the file
      const markdownWithMeta = fs.readFileSync(
         path.join('posts', postName + '.html'), 
         'utf-8'
      );
      // extract the header and body of the blog
      // from the file using front-matter
      const { attributes, body } = fm(markdownWithMeta);
      // pass the data to the Next.js renderer
      return {
         props: {
            blog: {
               metadata: {
                  id: attributes.id,
                  title: attributes.title
                  date: attributes.date,
               },
               content: body,
            },
         },
      };
   };
   </code>
</pre>

<p>Once the renderer recieves the data, it can fill stuff like the page title, description and image as well as the
   blog content itself. Then it can render the page.</p>

<h3 class="text-3xl mt-10">4. The hosting</h3>
<p class="mt-10">
   I chose <a href="https://vercel.com" target="_blank">Vercel</a> to host the project, because it offers
   great compatibility with Next.js, linking my domain was very simple and it's all for free.
</p>

<h3 class="text-3xl mt-10">5. Final thoughts</h3>
<p>I'm overall very happy with how the website turned out, the entire project took me around a week to finish. I'm also
   very
   excited to start posting more blogs and I'm curious to see if my blog system ever breaks.</p>
<h5 class="text-xl mt-8">Thank you for reading.</h5>
