  <p class="mt-5">
    Hello, today I will be comparing two of the most used backend languages - PHP and JavaScript(<a
      href="https://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a>). I will talk
    about their advantages and disadvantages, as well as best use cases. But first I want to clarify what a backend
    language is.
  </p>

  <h3 class="text-2xl mt-8 mb-5">1. What is a backend language</h3>
  <p>
    Backend, also server-side development is a portion of programming focused on storing and managing data like user
    accounts, cookies, blog posts, etc. That data is then provided to a website through number of data transfer
    protocols, the most common one is the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP" target="_blank">HTTP</a> protocol. So a
    backend language has to be able to at least receive and
    respond to user requests, communicate with a database and access the servers filesystem.
  </p>

  
  <h3 class="text-2xl mt-8 mb-5">2. What will be rated</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>- performance</li>
    <li>- simplicity</li>
    <li>- syntax</li>
    <li>- features</li>
    <li>- hosting options</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 class="text-2xl mt-8 mb-5">3. The comparison</h3>
  <h4 class="text-xl my-2">PHP</h2>
    <p>
      <a href="https://www.php.net/" target="_blank">PHP</a> is a web scripting language created in 1995 and is the most
      used backend language today. It is so popular because of it's ease of use
      and wide variety of features. However PHP is just a scripting language and it is not capable of running as a web
      server by itself - you need <a href="https://apache.org/" target="_blank">Apache</a> or a different http server in order to use
      it. This also removes some features like WebSocket communication or memory storage.
    </p>

    <h4 class="text-lg mt-5">Example PHP code:</h4>
    <pre>
      <code class="language-php">
  &lt;?php
    $message = "Hello world!";
    echo $message;
  ?&gt;
        </code>
      </pre>
    <h5 class="text-lg">
      Pros:
    </h5>
    <ul>
      <li>- it is very easy to use</li>
      <li>- it has many additional features out of the box</li>
      <li>- it is easy to host for free</li>
    </ul>

    <h5 class="text-lg">
      Cons:
    </h5>
    <ul>
      <li>- it only runs when a request is made</li>
      <li>- the syntax is unusual with lots of special characters</li>
      <li>- it has inconsistent naming of functions and utilities</li>
    </ul>
    <h4 class="text-xl my-2">Node.js</h2>
      <p><a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js</a> is a "JavaScript runtime environment" created in 2009. It uses
        JavaScript as it's programming language.
        Unlike PHP it works as an http server, so there is no need for additional software.</p>
      <h4 class="text-lg mt-5">Example Node.js code:</h4>
      <pre>
      <code class="language-javascript">
    const http = require('http');
    const message = "Hello world!";

    http.createServer((req, res) => {
      res.write(message);
      res.end();
    }).listen(8080);
        </code>
      </pre>
      <h5 class="text-lg">
        Pros:
      </h5>
      <ul>
        <li>- you don't need additional software for the http server</li>
        <li>- it has a big community of developers supporting it and creating new packages</li>
        <li>- it is written in JavaScript - you can use one language both on frontend and backend</li>
      </ul>

      <h5 class="text-lg">
        Cons:
      </h5>
      <ul>
        <li>- it is much more difficult to host online</li>
        <li>- it is harder to start with </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="text-2xl mt-8 mb-5">4. Conclusion</h3>

      <p>
        I personally prefer Node.js, because it is more modern, I like JavaScript and I like to have low level control
        over the http server. However it all depends on the project, you're building - if you're building a simple web
        app, or website, I would probably recommend PHP, maybe even WordPress.
